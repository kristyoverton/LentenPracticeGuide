But as we head toward Easter, it's time to consider the sabbath--as it pops up right in the middle of all this justice talk:\n\n'If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath\nand from doing as you please on my holy day,\nif you call the Sabbath a delight\nand the Lordâ€™s holy day honorable,\nand if you honor it by not going your own way\nand not doing as you please or speaking idle words,\nthen you will find your joy in the Lord,\nand I will cause you to ride in triumph on the heights of the land\nand to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob.'\nFor the mouth of the Lord has spoken."
